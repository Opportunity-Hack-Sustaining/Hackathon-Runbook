# Common Problem Statements

Now that we've run this 20+ times there are certain generalized problem statements we've seen more than once. Ok.  We've seen them a lot.  Ideally this means that these are problems we should create a single solve for.

# Volunteer registration and recommendation system 

This can be broken up into pieces and we can re-use some of the work we already have.

Typical requirements include:
* Registration
* Times available
* Duration
* Skill: Painting, Drywall, Electrical, Math Tutor, etc
* Definition of Opportunities (similar to Signup Genius)
* Number of people needed
* Date
* Duration
* Need to increase communication between NPO and volunteers - increase engagement
* Geographic: Find events within a given region or for specific companies
* Notifications: Notification over Facebook messenger
* Event Calendar: Facebook events automatically created for reminding people
* Recommendation of volunteering based on other people and previous volunteering experience

# Donation Recommendation system

* Recommend to person “you’ve donated a TV, do you also have some shoes?” (example)
* Analyze donation information (either item donations or monetary donations) and determine patterns to better apply marketing to donors

# Lightweight Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) (Could be used for tracking of patients or children)

* Quick registration system
* Record “treatments"
* Medicine
* Music
* Painting
* List of medicine providers
* Role based access
* Secure
* Export to CSV/Excel

# Automatic Volunteer Hour tracking

GPS device that monitors a geo-fence - records hours spent in a geo-fence - could be done with mobile app

# Inventory Management System

# Notification system for claiming of foster pets

# Prior year submissions

This is still a bit of mess, but the first cohesive attempt to document what we've seen with details.

### United Food Bank
Goal: Digitize volunteer signup forms and integrate with MS Access and Excel

Thought: Google Forms is great for signup as a one time shot, but it would be better if you could aggregate this data together over time with multiple forms. You could create a volunteer signup form and link that to other forms

### MilkMoney

https://devpost.com/software/milkmoney
Goal: Sync up volunteering opportunities with volunteers. Based on interest and past volunteering events, suggest and notfify people.

Something is here in terms of specifying the type of volunteering opportunity (eg. Painting), the size (eg. 10 people) and then notifying people when something similar is added. A user would provide their areas of interest, how often they want to volunteer, their skills and this platform would match them with corresponding opportunities.  You could integrate this into Facebook so that alerts and posts would directly happen over Messenger and Calendar events.

### Children Cancer Network 
Goal: Allow a community of people to interact with one another based on the type of cancer you have.
This could be done with a closed FB group depending on the type of cancer
