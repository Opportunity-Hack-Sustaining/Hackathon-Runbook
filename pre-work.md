In general you want to avoid having a case where you have dependencies that are interlocking, but there are some times it can not be avoided.  This is one of them.

1. You need to figure out the dates that you want to have the event.
2. You have to figure out where you want to have the event.
3. The venue will only be available on certain dates.
4. Your hackers might not be available for all dates.
5. Goto 1

In order to break this lockstep you should probably focus on venue first.

# Where (aka Venue selection)

* Available to be open around-the-clock from Saturday morning until Sunday evening
  * A lot of places are open to having a hackathon until the realize people will be there all night
* Bathrooms
* Area for hackers to work
  * Power available
  * wifi available (with all ports open)
* Place for food storage
* Auditorium for judging
* Audio/Visual available for keynote/intro/judging

# When (aka dates) 

1. You need to consider the availability of both your hackers and your NPOs. 
2. Depending on your hacker population, might limit their availability
3. Repeat

# Who (aka hackers)

We've tried all sorts of different audiences.  The fact of the matter is there is only one audience you should directly target as your hackers:
* College students

I could go into a lot of detail/discussion of why, but in the end, the rest of this document needs to get written, so not right now.

Given that you're targeting college students you'll want to engage with the local universities in the following ways:
* Professors and classes that are focused on
  * Software Engineering
  * Computer Science
* Clubs that are focused on
  * Software development
  * Diversity

Critical to this process is developing an on-going relationship.  Once you get the "flywheel" moving it will help you year after year.  It doesn't mean you don't have to do work, but it makes the whole hackathon easier in subsequent years.

*But* college students are only available during school times.  So, summers are out.  Spring break is out.  Christmas break is out.

Additionally, if you want to maximally incentivize college students, you want people hacking at times that make it so that you (and your sponsorship partners) can offer jobs/internships in the next six to nine months.
