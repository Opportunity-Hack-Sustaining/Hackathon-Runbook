# T minus 6 months

Now let's get into the process of defining exactly what needs to be done an when, by whom.

## Core team

You need to have your core team identified by now.  These are the people who will show up to the meetings and if there is some small task that doesn't get picked up, you know they'll be able to execute on it.

## Venue

You should have line-of-sight on a venue.  Without that, you can't have a date, so you can't be "T minus anything".  This is your highest priority to chase down.

## Recruiting

You need three people identified to act as coordinators for recruiting.  There can be some cross-over (e.g. your sponsor coordinator could help with a university pitch), but in general this will be their primary job.  If you ask them to do more, it's likely at a cost of effectiveness.

### Hackers

This is going to be your "University Relations" person.  The one person who knows (and will document) who you need to talk to in various departments and clubs.

### Hackees

This is your "NPO Relations" person.  They're going to be responsible for the mass-emailing and tracking of the various NPOs.

### Sponsors

"Company Relations".  This is a "long-tail" item because you're going to be dealing with other companies, which is like dealing with the government on a small scale.  It never moves as fast as you want and there is almost always someone else you're supposed to be talking to.  

This person is talking with the key stakeholder that is your advocate at the other companies.  In our experience it is useful to have some boilerplate [marketing agreement](resources/resources.md) that both sides can "sign" to allow for the use of things like logos.
