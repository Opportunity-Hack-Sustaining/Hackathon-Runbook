# Resources

A single place to consolidate the various resources to help you run the hackathon.  

# Hackathon Template Files

You should have view access to these, but you'll probably need to make copies for when you run the hackathon.

# Food

Here are the survey results from two years.  As you can see, there is a decent amount of regional variation.  If I were to generalize it would probably be something like:

* Plan for 33% vegetarian
* Plan for a handful of vegan
* Otherwise, the remainder is so small as to not be plannable

## 2019

* Arizona

  * ![2019 AZ Non-Hacker shirts](201910-az-shirt-sizes-non-hacker.png)

**Note:** I wouldn't trust those non-hacker numbers.  There were too few for the total number of mentors/volunteers/judges we had.  I just provide this here so there is __some__ data.
