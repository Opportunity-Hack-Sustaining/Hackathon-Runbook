# Devpost

You need a platform to allow you to do a few things:

* Get hacker signups
* Post rules
* Coordinate submissions
* Post winners

...and I'm sure there are several of those out there.  But, we've settled on [Devpost](https://www.devpost.com).

It just works.  It's free.  It's not without its quirks, but overall this is a platform and decision that we've never felt the need to revisit.
