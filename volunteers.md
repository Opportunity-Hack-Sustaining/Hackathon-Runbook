# Volunteers

## Overview

Don't over-complicate this.  Figure out how many different volunteers you need at the various times, setup a Signup Genius, and then get people to sign up.  The best sources of volunteers tend to be:

*  Employees for your company
*  Employees of the other [sponsoring](sponsors.md) companies
*  Family
*  Friends

## Positions

*  General Volunter

You will help us make sure the hackers are happy and well fed. Hackers may be slightly sleep deprived and would love for you to walk around to help them keep a clean environment. In their Redbull-induced focus, they may have forgotten to throw something away, or worse, forgot to eat food.

*  Registration and Signup 

Making sure that everyone registers using Google Forms.  After registration, Hackers will be asked to either eat some breakfast or head to the amphitheater - whatever their heart desires.

* Judging Runners

There is also a volunteering group for *Judging Runners*. This group of people will either be timing the judges or running back the judging forms to the control center so we can record their marks.

*  Photographers 

Our goal is to document this event so that both Phoenix and Arizona know how amazing our technical talent and our focus on community shine bright like the sun on a saguaro! Snap action photos, sleeping photos, engaged photos, happy photos - document through photos! Post on social media on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.  If you can put your photos in Google Photos, DropBox, and share them with us via email, that would be amazing.
