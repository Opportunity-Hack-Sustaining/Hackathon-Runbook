# Hackathon-Runbook

This is my first pass at creating a runbook of my/our thoughts on how to run Opportunity Hack.  There are a few caveats:
* Opportunity Hack has been run in a few different formats.  This runbook focuses on the full weekend varieties run in the US.  
* Even though we've gotten pretty good at these, there is always room for improvement, and we tune things every year.
  * Tuning is is not completely re-examining.

* Pre-work that must be done
  * Coordinating team
  * Where
  * When
  * Who
* Hackathon
  * Budget
    * Prizes
    * Venue
    * Food
    * SWAG
    * Bribes 
  * 6+ months
    * Recruiting 
      * Hackers
      * Hackees (i.e. NPOs)
      * Sponsors
  * 2+ months
    * Mentors
    * Volunteers
    * Judges
    * SWAG
      * Give aways
      * T-shirts
  * 1+ month
    * Food
    * Recruiting "roadshows"
* Hackathon "weekend" 
  * Judging
