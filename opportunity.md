# Opportunity Hack

So, what makes Opportunity Hack different? 

It is different than most hackathons, in that the hackers are working to solve a problem for a specific non-profit.  So, in that way the thing that makes it different is that the goal is to produce a production product for a charity.

But, I think there are a few other hackathons now doing similar things.  

In the end, I think the primary difference is the goal.

We bring together technologists and charities together to create lasting solutions for non-profits and lasting philanthropy for technologists.

Our goal is to make it so that technology professionals realize they can make a lasting difference in their communities, not just by writing a check, but by using their skills and expertise to help others.
